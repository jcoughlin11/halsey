# Introduction

This is ANNA (Arcade Neural Network Agent). It's a deep convolutional neural network built
on tensorflow and gym that's designed to learn how to play 2d games. The agent itself is
based off of the one given at [this site](https://simoninithomas.github.io/Deep_reinforcement_learning_Course/).

The agent is completely agnostic to the game it is learning. The only requirements
are that there be a gym environment for the game. Pretty much everything is controlled via the
parameter file.
