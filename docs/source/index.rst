Welcome to Halsey's documentation!
==================================

Hello! Thanks for stopping by! This is the documentation for Halsey. Halsey is
an open-source python package for deep reinforcement learning research that uses
`tensorflow 2.0 <https://www.tensorflow.org/>`_. Halsey derives its name from
the character of Dr. Catherine Elizabeth Halsey, whose brain forms the basis for
the AI Cortana in the Halo series.

The main goal behind Halsey's design is *modularity*. Since Halsey is meant
primarily as a research tool, the goal was to make it as straightforward
as possible to add new...anything, from neural network architectures,
loss functions, optimizers, to training loops and learning methods.

The second goal behind Halsey's design was *readability*. That is, taking
the **zen of python** (:pep:`20`) to heart.

Hopefully these docs are helpful and informative. Have a wonderful day!
