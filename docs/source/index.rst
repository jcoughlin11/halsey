Welcome to ANNA's documentation!
================================

Hello! Thanks for stopping by! This is the documentation for ANNA! ANNA
stands for the Arcade Neural Network Agent. It's an open-source
python package for deep reinforcement learning research that uses
`tensorflow 2.0 <https://www.tensorflow.org/>`_.

The main goal behind ANNA's design is *modularity*. Since ANNA is meant
primarily as a research tool, the goal was to make it as straightforward
as possible to add new...anything, from neural network architectures,
loss functions, optimizers, to training loops and learning methods.

The second goal behind ANNA's design was *readability*. That is, taking
the **zen of python** (:pep:`20`) to heart.

Hopefully these docs are helpful and informative. Have a wonderful day!
